# reacttrainingforcts

    Setup
        Visual Studio Code
        NodeJS: node --version
        npm install -g http-server

    Basic JS
        Losely typed language
        Not Pure OO language. Direct objects with classes
        Function are also first class objects
        DOM manipulation
    JQuery vs Javascript
    
    First React
        Steps:
            1. Create a class in React
            2. Create an object from class
            3. Render the object on the DOM
        No JS, JSX
            Transcompiler: Babel - Takes the JSX source code and transpile to JS
            * class="" --> className = ""
        Props vs States
            Properties are things that flow into the component
            States are things that are possesed by the component

    React vs Jquery

    Automate the trans-compilation
